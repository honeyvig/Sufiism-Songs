# Sufiism-Songs
Creating a Python script to gather Sufism songs, references, and generate new songs with beats requires multiple steps. Since it involves a combination of text scraping, music generation, and using external APIs or services, we’ll break it down into manageable pieces:

    Scrape Sufi Song Lyrics/References: You can use a web scraping library like BeautifulSoup or APIs from platforms like YouTube or Spotify to gather references to Sufi songs.
    Generate Music with Beats: For generating music, libraries such as pydub or third-party services like OpenAI’s music model (or even AI voice generation APIs) can be useful.
    Voice Artist Integration: You would need to use a voice artist generation API (like Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or some other service) to convert the Sufi song text into voice with beats.

Here’s a basic structure of how you can approach this using Python:
Requirements:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pydub google-cloud-texttospeech

Code to Scrape Sufi Song References (Using BeautifulSoup and Requests)

This part of the code will scrape some websites to find references or lyrics of Sufi songs.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_sufi_song_references():
    url = "https://example.com/sufi-songs"  # Replace with an actual website URL that lists Sufi songs
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    songs = []
    
    # Extract song titles and URLs or lyrics from the page (this will depend on the structure of the website)
    for song in soup.find_all('a', {'class': 'song-title'}):  # Replace with correct selector
        title = song.get_text()
        link = song['href']
        songs.append({"title": title, "link": link})
        
    return songs

sufi_songs = get_sufi_song_references()
for song in sufi_songs:
    print(f"Title: {song['title']}, Link: {song['link']}")

Code to Generate Music with Beats Using Pydub

For generating music beats, you can use the pydub library to combine audio files (like music loops or sound samples) and apply them to text-to-speech generated lyrics.

from pydub import AudioSegment

def create_song_with_beat(text, beat_file="beat.wav"):
    # Load the beat
    beat = AudioSegment.from_wav(beat_file)

    # Generate the lyrics (this would come from the TTS function below)
    lyrics_audio = generate_lyrics_audio(text)
    
    # Combine the lyrics with the beat
    combined = beat.overlay(lyrics_audio)
    
    # Export the final audio
    combined.export("sufi_song_with_beat.wav", format="wav")

def generate_lyrics_audio(text):
    # This is where you'd integrate the TTS functionality to generate the voice
    pass

Code to Use Text-to-Speech (TTS) API (e.g., Google Cloud TTS)

To generate audio from text (the lyrics of the Sufi song), you can use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or another service. Below is a basic example of using Google’s Text-to-Speech API.
Steps:

    Set up Google Cloud account and enable the Text-to-Speech API.
    Install Google Cloud’s library:

pip install google-cloud-texttospeech

    Use the following code to generate speech:

from google.cloud import texttospeech

def generate_audio_from_text(text):
    client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

    # Set the text input
    synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=text)

    # Set the voice parameters (you can change language, gender, etc.)
    voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
        language_code="en-US",
        ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.FEMALE
    )

    # Set the audio file format
    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16
    )

    # Perform the request to generate audio
    response = client.synthesize_speech(
        input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config
    )

    # Save the output to a file
    with open("output_audio.wav", "wb") as out:
        out.write(response.audio_content)

# Example of calling the function
generate_audio_from_text("This is a Sufi song lyric.")

Putting it all together:

    Scrape the Sufi song lyrics or references.
    Use a Text-to-Speech API (e.g., Google TTS) to generate audio of the lyrics.
    Combine this audio with beats using pydub or another music library.
    Export the final audio file.

Final Integration:

def main():
    # Get the Sufi song references (or lyrics directly)
    sufi_songs = get_sufi_song_references()
    
    for song in sufi_songs:
        song_text = "Extracted lyrics or references of the song."
        
        # Generate audio from lyrics
        generate_audio_from_text(song_text)
        
        # Add beats to the generated song
        create_song_with_beat(song_text, beat_file="beat.wav")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Note:

    Finding the Right Songs: You'll need to identify reliable websites for Sufi lyrics or music references. You might want to scrape lyrics databases or access YouTube API for audio.
    Music Generation: The actual process of generating high-quality beats or songs requires complex software. For simpler projects, you can start with existing beat loops and add voice layers on top.
    API Limitations: Be aware of rate limits when using external services like Google TTS.
